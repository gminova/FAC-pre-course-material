    <h3>How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
        was introduced?</h3>

    The diff command compares files line by line, while the -u (unified) option, by
    default, shows 3 lines of unified context to help understand typos, bugs and
    issues. This command significantly reduced the amount of lines I had to review
    in order to find the typo.<br>

    <h3>How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
        efficient programmer in the long term?</h3>

    Version-control systems (VCS), such as Git, can help a team keep track of who made
    a change and when. A good commit history shows how algorithms were developed
    and can provide access to an older working version of your code. Using Git boosts
    performance, ensures security and offers flexibility when working in a team.<br>

    <h3>What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
        commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
        docs does?</h3>

    Pros: Manually pushing code on GitHub enables us to test our code first.
    This helps keep the commit history clean, logical and easy to follow. Git prevents
    conflicts when changes made by multiple developers override each other.<br>
    <br>
    Cons: It is time consuming to manually commit changes and it can lead to a loss of
    logical flow if commits are inconsistent or have poor descriptions. Version-control
    can be hard to learn, however once mastered it increases developement speed.<br>

    <h3>Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
        files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?</h3>

    Git records changes as a stream of snapshots and acts as a global information
    tracker for inter-dependant files, which are all part of a project. A logical
    change can affect multiple files, hence a single commit reflecting changes in
    multiple files is more appropriate. Git commit history can be accessed offline, 
    whereas Google Doc's history can be accessed online only. Over- or under-commiting
    can make reverting to a previous version of your code harder. Google docs, by 
    contrast, is a tool used for creating single independent files.<br>

    <h3>How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?</h3>

    Git log shows the whole log history (all commits) for all files, while git diff 
    shows changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc. and allows to look at
    specific changes line by line.<br>

    <h3>How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
        could break something?</h3>

    Keeping track of changes helps understand when and why code breaks, as well as 
    who introduced the 'faulty' change. Having a back-up allows developers to revert to
    a stable version of the code, ensuring the usability of a project until a better
    working version is released.<br>

    <h3>Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?</h3>

    To keep track of my work and progress, as well as collaborate in group projects.<br>
